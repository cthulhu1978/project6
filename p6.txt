turnin code:  cs_p6


Write a program that loops doing:

    sleep(1);

It should print this message each time it receives SIGUSR1:

    received SIGUSR1

When the program has received 4 SIGUSR1 signals, it should print this message:

    terminating due to 4 SIGUSR1 signals

and then terminate.

If a SIGUSR2 (2 instead of 1) is received, print:

    received SIGUSR2

and terminate immediately.


BE SURE TO HAVE THIS AS THE FIRST EXECUTABLE LINE IN YOUR PROGRAM:

    alarm(90)


As in prior projects, if the program is run with a single command-line arg
of  -hw  then it should simply  print hello world   and then  exit(0)


TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir named p6dir:
	tar cvf p6.tar ./p6dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    After un-tarring your project, I will cd to the dir containing
    it and type:
        rm -rf p6
        rm -f *.o
        make
    It should build an executable named p6 as described above.
    Sample un-tar, build, and simple execution will be provided in the script
    p6testfiles/PREP.py which must execute correctly to be graded further.
